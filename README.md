# Graduate Teaching Assistant AI and ML

## Brief Introduction

I was Graudate Teaching Assistant to a senior course on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for 100 - 120 students. Senior Course on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning was one of the more interesting course. The teacher was awesome and gave a lot of interesting assignments. It was up to to the GTA to discuss these ideas, elaborate concepts and guide the students. Most of the effort was in maintaining office hours. 

Students were quite matured by then and didn't expect a lot from the GTA. I never had a single soul turn up for the office hours. Grading was quite simple too. I could get the entire work done in 2 hours/week.

## My reponsibilities towards graduate teaching assistant

## Benefits of becoming a Graduate Teaching Assistant

GTA give me an opportunity to extend my knowledge and acquire new skills. These include teaching, communicating and the ability to breakdown complex theories in a way which can be easier understood. 

Besides this, teaching students is an excellent way to develop my abilities. It helps me to consolidate my existing technical knowledge, gain knowledge in new topics and get valuable hands-on experience in teaching. This is a significant advantage. Undertaking the duties of a GTA adequately helps me prepare for a career as a daily learner, and provide me  with a strong foundation that can use to sell myself when applying to new job as Data Science developer.


## Added several articles to learn more

### Week 01

Before moving to course "Articial Intelligence and Machine Learning", I have added 3 articles based on **History of Artificial Intelligence**, **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, and **Performance Metrics in Machine Learning Classification Model**.
