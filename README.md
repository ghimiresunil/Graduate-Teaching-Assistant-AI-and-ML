# Graduate Teaching Assistant AI and ML

## Brief Introduction

I was Graudate Teaching Assistant to a senior course on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for 100 - 120 students. Senior Course on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning was one of the more interesting course. The teacher was awesome and gave a lot of interesting assignments. It was up to to the GTA to discuss these ideas, elaborate concepts and guide the students. Most of the effort was in maintaining office hours. 

Students were quite matured by then and didn't expect a lot from the GTA. I never had a single soul turn up for the office hours. Grading was quite simple too. I could get the entire work done in 2 hours/week.
